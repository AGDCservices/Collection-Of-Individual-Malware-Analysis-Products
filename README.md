# Collection Of Individual Malware Analysis Products
This repository contains analysis products for specific malware samples. Most notably will generally be an annotated disassembler file e.g. Ghidra .gzf, along with any additional scripts that were used during the mark-up process. This will allow you to review the annotated assembly view so that you can practice on your own and have a solution guide to compare to. All malware samples referenced in this page can be downloaded from https://www.malshare.com/
